date
- no magic date parsing for -d, but it supports a -D argument like busybox
  inutility date -d 10:20:30 -D %H:%M:%S     -> Tue Jul 19 10:20:30 CEST 2016

dd
- doesn't implement cbs yet
  maybe one day it will, maybe not
- posix requires this idiocy:  dd bs=2x3x4
- posix also requires this to mean 512 byte:  dd bs=1b

printf
- printf "%*s" "$width" foo  doesn't work yet
  you can use printf "%${width}s" foo
