- improve tac for regular files
- improve head -c -1234
- (maybe) improve head -c -1234 for regular files?
- compile all the files in the same compilation unit
- dd cbs and related conversions
- utf8 aware rev
- find a way to handle option parsing like in unshare
- kill -TERM
- find a way to implement grep -wo correctly
  grep -wo 'a.*b' <<< ab.abc
  should print ab, but it's not easy to do
  toybox and busybox print nothing
- fix envsubst <<< '$$PATH'
